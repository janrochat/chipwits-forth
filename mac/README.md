# MacForth

The source code for ChipWits was written in MacForth, a version of the Forth programming language.
This repository does not contain the MacForth compiler or runtime, but you can find more information
about MacForth at the [Macintosh Repository](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/49896-macforth-plus).

# Disks

The following disks have been restored. The directory names match the
labels on the disks.

These disks were imaged by John Morris, using Applesauce. The images are in the `.dc42` format.

The one exception is `CW Source From Fan` which was imaged on a PowerBook G3 Wallstreet. As it was
already returned to the fan, there was no way for John to image it.

# Opening the Disks

The disks can be opened in a Mac emulator such as [Mini vMac](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/).
You need to boot with a system disk first. Some of these disks have the system installed as well, others don't.

# Readable FORTH Source
The `forth/` directory contains semi-recovered source code, re-encoded so that it can be
read by a modern computer. The code is non-normative and will not compile.
