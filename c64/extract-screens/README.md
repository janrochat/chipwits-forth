# Chipwits FORTH Screen Utilities

This project contains utilities for working with FORTH screens on Commodore 64 (C64) D64 disk images.

## Scripts

### `write_forth_screens.py`

This script reads screens from a FORTH file and writes them back to a D64 file. For detailed usage instructions, see the [README_write_forth_screens.md](README_write_forth_screens.md) file.

### `dump_forth_screens.py`

This script extracts all FORTH screens from a D64 file and outputs them either to a specified file or to the console. For detailed usage instructions, see the [README_dump_forth_screens.md](README_dump_forth_screens.md) file.
